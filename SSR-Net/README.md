## Abstract
This paper presents a novel CNN model called Soft Stagewise Regression Network (SSR-Net) for age estimation from a single image with a compact model size. Inspired by DEX, we address age estimation by performing multi-class classification and then turning classification results into regression by calculating the expected values. SSR-Net takes a coarse-to-fine strategy and performs multi-class classification with multiple stages. Each stage is only responsible for refining the decision of the previous stage. Thus, each stage performs a task with few classes and requires few neurons, greatly reducing the model size. For addressing the quantization issue introduced by grouping ages into classes, SSR-Net assigns a dynamic range to each age class by allowing it to be shifted and scaled according to the input face image. Both the multi-stage strategy and the dynamic range are incorporated into the formulation of soft stagewise regression. A novel network architecture is proposed for carrying out soft stagewise regression. The resultant SSR-Net model is very compact and takes only **0.32 MB**. Despite of its compact size, SSR-Netâ€™s performance approaches those of the state-of-the-art methods whose model sizes are more than 1500x larger.

## Codes

There are three different section of this project. 
1. Data pre-processing
2. Training and testing
3. Video demo section
We will go through the details in the following sections.

This repository is for IMDB, WIKI, and Morph2 datasets.


### 1. Data pre-processing
+ Download IMDB-WIKI dataset (face only) from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/.
+ Morph2 dataset requires application form https://www.faceaginggroup.com/morph/
+ Unzip them under './data'
+ Run the following codes for dataset pre-processing.
```
cd ./data
python TYY_IMDBWIKI_create_db.py --db imdb --output imdb.npz
python TYY_IMDBWIKI_create_db.py --db wiki --output wiki.npz
python TYY_MORPH_create_db.py --output morph_db_align.npz
```

### 2. Training and testing

<img src="https://github.com/shamangary/SSR-Net/blob/master/merge_val_morph2.png" height="300"/>

The experiments are done by randomly choosing 80% of the dataset as training and 20% of the dataset as validation (or testing). The details of the setting in each dataset is in the paper.

For MobileNet and DenseNet:
```
cd ./training_and_testing
sh run_all.sh
```
For SSR-Net:
```
cd ./training_and_testing
sh run_ssrnet.sh
```
+ Note that we provide several different hyper-parameters combination in this code. If you only want a single hyper-parameter set, please alter the command inside "run_ssrnet.sh".

**Plot the results:**
For example, after the training of IMDB dataset, you want to plot the curve and the results.
Copy "plot.sh", "ssrnet_plot.sh", and "plot_reg.py" into "./imdb_models".
The following command should plot the results of the training process.
```
sh plot.sh
sh ssrnet_plot.sh
```

### 3. Video demo section
Pure CPU demo command:
```
cd ./demo
KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='' python TYY_demo_mtcnn.py TGOP.mp4

# Or you can use

KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='' python TYY_demo_mtcnn.py TGOP.mp4 '3'
```
+ Note: You may choose different pre-trained models. However, the morph2 dataset is under a well controlled environment and it is much more smaller than IMDB and WIKI, the pre-trained models from morph2 may perform ly on the in-the-wild images. Therefore, IMDB or WIKI pre-trained models are recommended for in-the-wild images or video demo.

+ We use dlib detection and face alignment in the previous experimental section since the face data is well organized. However, dlib cannot provide satisfactory face detection for in-the-wild video. Therefore we use mtcnn as the detection process in the demo section.

### Real-time webcam demo

Considering the face detection process (MTCNN or Dlib) is not fast enough for real-time demo. We show a real-time webcam version by using lbp face detector.

```
cd ./demo
KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='' python TYY_demo_ssrnet_lbp_webcam.py
```
+ Note that the covered region of face detection is different when you use MTCNN, Dlib, or LBP. You should choose similar size between the inference and the training.
+ Also, the pre-trained models are mainly for the evaluation of the datasets. They are not really for the real-world images. You should always retrain the model by your own dataset. In webcam demo, we found that morph2 pre-trained model actually perform better than wiki pre-trained model. The discussion will be included in our future work.
+ If you are Asian, you might want to use the megaage_asian pre-trained model.
+ The Morph2 pre-trained model is good for webcam but the gender model is overfitted and not practical.

### 4. Extension

### Training the gender model

We can reformulate binary classification problem into regression problem, and SSR-Net can be used to predict the confidence.
For example, we provide gender regression and demo in the code for the extension.

Training the gender network:
```
cd ./training_and_testing
sh run_ssrnet_gender.sh
```
Note that the score can be between [0,1] and the 'V' inside SSR-Net can be changed into 1 for general propose regression.
